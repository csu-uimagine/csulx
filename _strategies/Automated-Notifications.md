### Overview

This strategy involves the teacher or marker being informed via EASTS as soon as students have submitted work for specific assessment tasks. The perceived benefit of this approach is that academics can then avoid needing to periodically check their online ‘pigeon hole’ for submitted work and potentially improve time management by avoiding the cluster points characteristic of traditional marking.

### Engagement

In the event that the teacher is notified quickly of a submission and acts on this with a rapid return of feedback, then the student could potentially feel more engaged in the subject.

MGT220 eCommerce

#### Teaching Staff

#### Motivation

To help speed up assessment processes by removing the digital 'Pigeon hole’ which requires staff having to go and look to see if work is there to be marked. There were also benefits to marking as a result of progressive notification.

#### Implementation

EASTS automated notifications were used for specific assessments in MGT220. The teaching academic utilises the daily digest function within EASTS to be notified automatically when student work has been submitted - this then allows a more reflexive approach to marking, at the discretion of the academic. This is also supports a faster turnaround time (Rapid Return) of assessment tasks.

### Guide

Markers may choose a number of email notification options for each assignment they mark to alert them of submitted files. The notification options are as follows:

**On Submit Notification** – sent upon successful submission by a student. The student’s submission details will be reflected in the email. Markers who have nominated on-submit notification emails for an assessment item will receive an email similar to the one below each time a student makes a submission for that item.
