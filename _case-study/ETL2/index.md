### Background to ETL523

ETL523 Digital Citizenship in Schools is a subject in the postgraduate degree Master of Education in Knowledge Networks and Digital Innovation (School of Information Studies).

Technological, political and ethical issues concerning digital citizenship are examined, including intellectual property, plagiarism, cybersafety, freedom of information, transliteracy and the effective use of a range of technologies to support learning and teaching.
