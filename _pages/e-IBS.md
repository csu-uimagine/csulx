### Summary

Student learning is enhanced through online peer learning activities aligned with the subject outcomes and actively facilitated by an online teacher. These activities may be conducted synchronously or asynchronously and student participation and learning benefits are highest when they support the completion of assessment tasks. This element supports enhanced learner-learner engagement.

The Interaction Between Students element is exemplified by:

- Synchronous and asynchronous discussions that allow students to share their experiences, knowledge and perspectives.
- Peer-to-peer teaching activities.
- Collaborative small group projects.
- Online reflective journals including video or audio blogs, allowing peer comments and feedback.
- Co-operative inquiry-based or problem-based learning activities.
- Co-creation of authentic learning products.

### Literature Review

In face to face learning contexts studies going back to the 1980s have consistently found that well designed cooperative and collaborative learning strategies can lead to substantial learning benefits in both school and university contexts (Johnson, Johnson, & Smith, 1998; Slavin, 1996). One of the key benefits of such approaches is the way in which it supports students in obtaining regular and timely feedback from their peers as they construct and articulate their own personal representation of the ideas and concepts within a subject. While, years of empirical research have demonstrated the learning benefits of one to one tutoring as the consistently most effective teaching strategy with the highest effect size in terms of student achievement (Bloom, 1984), cooperative learning and peer teaching strategies have been repeatedly found to be one of the most effective alternatives (see for example Fuchs et al, 1997) , and in a higher education context where individual teacher support is always going to be limited, the latter is clearly more feasible (refs).

In a distance education and online learning context, the importance of interaction between students has been advocated by a number of seminar authors (e.g. Moore, 1989) and has been a key element of seminar models (e.g. Garrison’s Community of Inquiry Model, Garrison, Anderson & Archer, 1999).  Kreijns et al. (2002) suggest that social interaction facilitated by computer supported cooperative learning has the capacity to encourage shared understanding, critical thinking and the social construction of knowledge. 

Interactive learning activities may be conducted synchronously or asynchronously. In some situations online communication can be superior to face-to-face because asynchronous written communication can provide a better site for reflective and precise communication than the “spontaneous and fleeting” site of real-time verbal communication (Garrison, 2000b, p. 10).

Consistent with Biggs’ (1996) notion of constructive alignment it is well known that student participation and consequently learning benefits are highest when collaborative and cooperative learning activities support the completion of assessment tasks. Further, the importance of designing learning activities incorporating structured opportunities for students to interact and collaborate, rather than assuming that incidental interaction between students will lead to the same benefits is also well established. Borokhovski et al. (2012), for example, describe a meta analysis of designed versus incidental online student–student interaction finding clear benefits for designed interaction. Cooperative learning research over many years has also demonstrated that unstructured group work is inferior to designs which ensure individual and group accountability along with positive interdependence (see Putnam, 1998, Slavin, 1991). Finally, Bernard and Rubalcava (2000) demonstrate the importance of carefully considering the learner characteristics and the learning context if the potential benefits of collaborative learning in a distance or online context are to be realised.
