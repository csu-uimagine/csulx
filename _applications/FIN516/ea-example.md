### Motivation

Using a scoring system many quiz based learning technologies can provide auto-marking and automated feedback. The use of scoring can help motivate students as it introduces an element of competition, whether it is with themselves or with others. The element of competition encourages multiple attempts to achieve mastery. There is also the reduction of anxiety as the students get to play with the tools, environment and practice the types of questions that they will have in their summative assessments.

### Implementation

A pool of questions was set up using calculated formulas type questions. Each question has a variety of placeholders that substitute for a number. This allows for an exponential number of question variations for students to practice. Question sets were created in the tests to draw from these pools of calculated questions, so any attempt would get **individualised practice focused tasks**.
