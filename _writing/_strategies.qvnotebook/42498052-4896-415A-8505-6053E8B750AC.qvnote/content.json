Taking the text of others and using it without proper referencing or acknowledgement is a commonly accepted definition of plagiarism (Culwin and Lancaster 2001). More specifically, student plagiarism can be defined as a form of cheating with the intent of gaining academic credit for work which is not their own and academic institutions should be concerned about this since student plagiarism appears to be on the increase (Culwin and Lancaster 2001; Park 2004).\n\nMany students do not view the risk of being caught for plagiarism as serious enough to change behaviour and stop cheating with some authors indicating that students weigh up the benefits of cheating against the risk and the consequences of being caught (Park 2004). As a result, Park (2004) concludes that one of the best deterrents to plagiarism is  the development of a robust system that is appropriate, fair, transparent and well publicised and consistently used across the university.\n\nDuring the last decade, electronic plagiarism detection has advanced greatly and once cumbersome detection techniques have become straightforward and routine for both academics and students with systems such as Turnitin.\n\n### Engagement\n\nStudies such as Dahl (2007) have found students welcome the introduction of plagiarism software as a way to prevent plagiarism. Specifically, students seemed to like the  formative aspect which allows them to seek advice on how to reference correctly if reports identify an issue prior to submission. The knowledge that plagiarism software is being used has also worked as a deterrent to decrease plagiarism and better understand referencing and writing techniques. "

Students are expected to familiarise themselves with these requirements and ensure that all assessments submitted are their own work, have not been submitted elsewhere and comply with the University's requirements for academic integrity.\n\nCSU has access to Turnitin software which can be used in a pre-emptive function for students to check their own work prior to submission, and a plagiarism detection function which academics may use to check the student’s work for improper citation or potential plagiarism. The use in this subject is optional and is not a prerequisite for submission. However, students are encouraged to check their work for originality prior to submission. \n\n#### Implementation\nIn BMS346 students are directed to Turnitin from the subject outline to check their own work. They are asked to declare that the assignment is their own work (using an electronically signed statement through EASTS) and that they are aware of the policy and plagiarism detection tools.\n\nAs well as referring students to Turnitin, they are also given information on:\n- referencing styles,\n- how to reference, including use of referencing programs such as Endnote, \n- how to perform a literature search, and \n- how to  transfer knowledge into their own words. \n\nPlagarism-Checking-BMS346.png\n\n</div>\n</div>"
