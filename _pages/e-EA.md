Digital technologies present new possibilities for the ways in which students undertake and submit assessment tasks, the way in which feedback is provided and the kinds of learner activities that can be assessed. Authentic assessment tasks which require students to demonstrate practices of the target profession can be provisioned in ways that scaffold students and ensure professional and practice-based learning outcomes. This element supports enhanced learner-content and learner-learner engagement.

The e-Assessment element is exemplified by:

- Construction of rich media artefacts modelled on the products of the profession.
- ePortfolios to capture student reflections and record and demonstrate professional practice capabilities.
- Blogs and online journals for formative and summative assessment.
- Self-marking quizzes.
- Automated plagiarism checking, online marking and online peer assessment.
- Badges for micro-credentialing of competencies. 
- Contemporary computer-based exams with remote exam invigilation.
