The Online Learning Exchange was created by the [u!magine team](http://www.uimagine.edu.au) as a resource for Charles Sturt University staff to engage with the Online Learning Model. 

The Learning Exchange is an evolving resource that will be updated throughout the year as we work to scale up the implementation of the Online Learning model. The long term aim is to provide staff with a space to share practices and implementations of the various strategies. We want to support the autonomy of individual teaching staff by providing access to examples of practice and the information they need to make changes to their own subjects and practices. These in turn can be shared those with the whole CSU community - connecting knowledge across the institution by operating outside our traditional silos.
