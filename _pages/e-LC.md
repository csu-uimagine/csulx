Feeling part of and actively contributing to a learning community is directly linked to student motivation and resilience. Studying within learning groups can be an important foundation for effective interaction between students, their peers and teachers in support of deeper learning. Proactive support from teachers for learning within smaller groups, provided synchronously or asynchronously, is important if the benefits of intellectual rigour and deep engagement are to be achieved. This element supports enhanced learner-teacher and learner-learner engagement.

The Learning Communities element is exemplified by: 

- Smaller sub cohorts within large cohorts facilitated by a tutor who guides community building, provides formative feedback and marks summative assessment tasks.
- Orientation, socialisation and personalisation of the online environment prior to curriculum focused learning activities.
- Contribution to a shared resource such as a gallery of photos from professional placement.
- Social media streams using tools such as Twitter, Instagram or shared bookmarking.
