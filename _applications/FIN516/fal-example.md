description: |
  The use of adaptive release in this case, was to provide flexible delivery of content and to support students in this subject who were not completing the end of topic quizzes, formative, non-graded tasks designed to provide practice and revision of skills. There is a strong correlation between those who do not complete the end of topic quizzes, and those who struggle with the assessable tests and exam. Student evaluation survey data from pre and post implementation for this subject showed 11% decrease in Fails and over 25% increase in Distinctions. As each topic builds on previous knowledge, the non-graded revision quizzes provide the opportunity for instant feedback to identify and correct misconceptions and improve future assessment performances.

  Content release in FIN516 utilised 2 adaptive rules. It was designed for release on both a score of the previous topic quiz (50%) and the date that the topic would normally be studied in the usual 14 week cycle (so no-one is disadvantaged). Students can accelerate through a topic and are in control of their learning and developing skill level.  The unlimited attempts allowed students the freedom to test their knowledge and return to the test during the session for revision and exam preparation.
