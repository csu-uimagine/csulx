Online strategies which connect students with professionals and sites of professional practice can provide a valuable context for engagement with subject content and make clearer the relevance of the subject learning outcomes by connecting theory to practice. This engagement also supports the development of professional capabilities, induction into the culture and values of the profession, and an ethos of lifelong learning and career planning. This element supports enhanced learner-community engagement.


The Interaction with the Professions element is exemplified by:

- Case studies that highlight professional contexts through rich media.
- Guest online lectures by professional practitioners.
- Authentic practice-focused assessment tasks.
- Assessment tasks requiring students to draw on and reflect upon placements.
- Online discussions with peers and teachers during work placements.
- Online role plays and simulations.
- Online mentoring and professional networking.
- Video conference connections to sites of practice.
