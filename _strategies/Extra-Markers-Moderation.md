### Overview

Extra markers may be hired to cope with rapid return of assessments. This places more pressure on the  moderation process as an increased number of markers working in a short time frame compounds the complexity.

Individual Schools may have different processes for managing the allocation of marking support but subjects with larger cohorts will often require additional markers. This necessitates more detailed moderation from the Subject Coordinator. Refer to [the CSU Moderation Policy](https://policy.csu.edu.au/document/view-current.php?id=322) for guidelines for successful moderation practices.

#### Subject

MGT310 Operations Management

#### Teaching Staff

Paul Forbes

#### Motivation

To provide students with more rapid feedback for their assessments .

#### Implementation

Where funding is provided for additional marking appropriate markers may be contracted from a pool identified by the School or through professional networks.

MGT310 has an online and multiple on campus cohorts with large numbers. Three case study based tasks were targeted for rapid return. Additional markers were contracted and a moderation process implemented.

### Guide

Setting up for success

Share the information contained in the moderation portal on the [CSU Assessment ](https://www.csu.edu.au/division/learning-and-teaching/home/assessment-and-moderation)site

* Hold a moderation meeting using Adobe Connect in the week prior to the start of session.
* Conduct a follow up moderation meeting once assessments have been submitted to ensure consistency
* When using Rapid Return and Open due dates, if possible try to employ 1-2 markers per Assessment Item to ensure consistency. If assessments are trickling in over weeks rather than all at once, then this is feasible.
