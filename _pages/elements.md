### Overview

The Online Learning Model consists of a set of elements designed to increase student engagement, retention and overall satisfaction. The model builds on Moore’s (1989) model which incorporates learner-teacher, learner-learner and learner-content interaction. The model broadens Moore’s notion of interactivity to one of engagement and adds learner-community engagement as a key component of professional courses, as well as learner-institution engagement to ensure a connected student experience. 

This then leads to five categories of student engagement: 

- learner-teacher engagement
- learner-learner engagement
- learner-content engagement
- learner-community engagement, and
- learner-institution engagement. 

Each of the seven elements of the Online Learning Model are designed to increase one or more types of engagement. The elements, which are outlined in the following sections, are designed to be combined together in varying degrees of intensity within the subjects making up a course. The intention is that a specific subject might implement about three or four elements rather than the entire model.

The Seven Elements are:

- [Interaction Between Students]({{ site.baseurl }}/elements/interaction-students.html)
- [Teacher Presence]({{ site.baseurl }}/elements/teacher-presence.html)
