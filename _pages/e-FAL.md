The diversity of contemporary online learning cohorts requires learning experiences that are designed for high engagement but are flexible and adaptive to the needs of autonomous learners. Adaptivity in learning design, online teaching and student support has been made possible by technologies providing timely data on learnersâ€™ knowledge, perceptions and study behaviour. Alongside this, flexibility in the timing and mode of engagement with teachers, peers and learning content, and data driven feedback on study approaches can promote agile and personalised learning experiences. This element supports enhanced learner-content, learner-learner, learner-teacher and learner-institutional engagement.

The Flexible and Adaptive Learning element is exemplified by: 

- Subject and course design informed by data drawn from student and peer feedback, research and learning analytics.
- Data informed during session adaptation of teaching strategies and resources.
- Data informed recommendations for students to connect with university support services.
- Dashboards that provide feedback to students on their learning strategies.
- Flexible or adaptive lesson, subject or course designs providing individualised pathways based on demonstration of knowledge and competency.
- Flexibility in assessment providing opportunities for students to build on their specific discipline knowledge or professional expertise.
