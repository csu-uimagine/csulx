High quality rich media learning resources can support understanding of conceptual material, provide visual examples of practice and contextualise the broader learning experience. Interactive learning resources can provide a place for experiential engagement and experimentation with content and interaction with peers and teachers. Resources can be curated from those available commercially, within Open Educational Resource libraries or MOOCs, or developed and quality assured by teaching and educational design staff, students or media specialists. This element supports enhanced learner-content engagement.

The Interactive Resources element is exemplified by:

- Video resources to contextualise online discussions.
- Rich media resources supporting problem based or cooperative learning activities.
- Critical reflection upon cases illustrated through photos, audio or video.
- Conceptual simulations supporting exploratory learning strategies.
- Immersive environments where students undertake simulated professional practice.
