### Overview

The Online Learning Model consists of a set of elements designed to increase student engagement, retention and overall satisfaction. The model builds on Moore’s (1989) model which incorporates *learner-teacher*, *learner-learner* and *learner-content* interaction. The model broadens Moore’s notion of interactivity to one of engagement and adds *learner-community* engagement as a key component of professional courses, as well as *learner-institution* engagement to ensure a connected student experience.

This then leads to five categories of student engagement:

- learner-teacher engagement
- learner-learner engagement
- learner-content engagement
- learner-community engagement, and
- learner-institution engagement.

Each of the seven elements of the Online Learning Model are designed to increase one or more types of engagement. The elements, which are outlined in the following sections, are designed to be combined together in varying degrees of intensity within the subjects making up a course. The intention is that a specific subject might emphasise about three or four elements rather than the entire model.

### Interactivity & Engagement

The association of engagement with increased persistence, improved student learning outcomes and achievement (Hoskins, 2012; Leach & Zepke, 2011; Sinatra, Heddy, & Lombardi, 2015), reduced drop out (Sinatra et al., 2015), and increased retention rates (Hoskins, 2012; Leach & Zepke, 2011) have lead to the claim that it is the “holy grail of learning” (Sinatra et al., 2015, p. 1). While some researchers suggest that such correlations between engagement and student outcomes are unclear (Axelson & Flick, 2010, p. 42), many researchers believe that there are unequivocal links between engagement and student success, learning and achievement (Kahn, 2014; F. Newmann, Wehlage, & Lamborn, 1992; F. M. Newmann, 1992; Zepke, 2014). The link between engagement and student retention is particularly important in a distance education context where high attrition has been a consistent problem (Carr, 2000).
 
The term engagement has been used in a number of different ways in the research literature. Initially definitions of student engagement focused on aspects of student involvement and investment in learning (Axelson & Flick, 2010; F. Newmann et al., 1992), shifting to an emphasis on student behaviours (Collins & O'Brien, 2011; Dykstra Steinbrenner & Watson, 2015; Zepke, 2014). This recent focus on student behaviours is particularly noticeable in the major survey instruments used to measure student engagement in the United States, through the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), and in Australia, through the Australasian Survey of Student Engagement (AUSSE) (Axelson & Flick, 2010; Kahu, 2013).
 
The complex and multidimensional nature of engagement can be seen in the development of a range of models of student engagement which include consideration of: student motivation and agency, interactions with teachers and other students, institutional and non-institutional influences, behavioural, emotional and cognitive elements and socio-cultural, structural and psycho-social elements (Kahu, 2013; Leach & Zepke, 2011). Models have become more student-centred as researchers have focussed on the identification of indicators and facilitators of engagement. CSU’s Online Learning Model builds on this work using Moore (Moore, 1989, 2007, 2009; Moore & Kearsley, 1996) as a foundation.

A central element of Moore’s transactional distance theory was the conception of the three categories of interaction in distance education:
 
- Learner-Content Interaction, “the process of intellectually interacting with content that results in changes in the learner's understanding, the learner's perspective, or the cognitive structures of the learner's mind” (Moore, 1989, p. 2);
- Learner-Instructor Interaction which involves various steps including: stimulating student engagement, presenting material, organising the application of the material, evaluating students, making adjustments to student learning as well as counselling and encouraging students; and
- Learner-Learner Interaction – which involves students interacting in groups with or without the presence of the teacher.
 
Moore’s notion of interaction has been argued to be central to DE student engagement (Wallace, 2003; Yates, 2014). Consistent with this connection between interaction and engagement, in developing the CSU model Moore’s focus on interaction has been expanded to a focus on engagement, with each of the seven elements focusing on one or more categories of student engagement.
