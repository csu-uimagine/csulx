Particles each come with their own set of default settings which may or may not be configured in the Particle's YAML file. These defaults are then inherited by the Base Outline in the Particle Defaults panel. From there, you can modify these defaults within the Base Outline, Sub Outlines, and even in the specific particle instance as it appears in the Layout Manager, Menu Editor, Module or Widget.
