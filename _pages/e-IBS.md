Student learning is enhanced through online peer learning activities aligned with the subject outcomes and actively facilitated by an online teacher. These activities may be conducted synchronously or asynchronously and student participation and learning benefits are highest when they support the completion of assessment tasks. This element supports enhanced learner-learner engagement.

The Interaction Between Students element is exemplified by:

- Synchronous and asynchronous discussions that allow students to share their experiences, knowledge and perspectives.
- Peer-to-peer teaching activities.
- Collaborative small group projects.
- Online reflective journals including video or audio blogs, allowing peer comments and feedback.
- Co-operative inquiry-based or problem-based learning activities.
- Co-creation of authentic learning products.
