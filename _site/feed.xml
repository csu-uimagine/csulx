        <title>Orientation to the Environment</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online learning environment can often be a daunting place for new and continuing students. It lacks the familiarity of a classroom, so it is important that students become familiar with the conventions of the learning management system and how it will be utilised in the teaching of your subject. Clearly defining places and spaces for students to have discussions, making them aware of where information is located, how it’s expected to be accessed and what channels of communication are available are important steps in this process. Ensuring students are comfortable with the environment and the expectations of how they will be learning are key for students navigating their way through their studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement&quot;&gt;Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If students are familiar with the learning environment they will feel more comfortable to engaging in the learning process. If students are unsure of processes or expectations, where to locate information, or how to communicate the learning environment will feel foreign and difficult to work in. Adopting an orientation process in the subject provides the kind of wayfaring and signage that we find in a physical space. Signposting key information and providing logical navigation assist students in finding their way in the online environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-practice&quot;&gt;In Practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;subject&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSS032&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;teaching-staff&quot;&gt;Teaching staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart McKinney&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject &lt;em&gt;SSS032 Introduction to Learning Online&lt;/em&gt; was developed explicitly to orient students to studying online at CSU. Ensuring students are comfortable in using the communication technologies is paramount to their success as it forms the bedrock of their interaction with the peers and teaching staff. Students must be capable of using a variety of i2 and other CSU supported technologies to succeed in their study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject is open to all students throughout the year and provides them with a scaffolded way of exploring the main tools and features of Interact2. Students are introduced to key technologies through simple videos, and text modules that are then enacted upon through a structured activity. In this way students are provided with a model of how a tool works, and then a practical engagement with it by completing a task. By the end of the course which is around 10 hours in total, students have learnt about Interact2 but have used the tools too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guide&quot;&gt;Guide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Interact2 provides a common interface and set of tools for students, they can be used in quite different ways in the teaching of a subject. Providing students with a “guided tour” of the learning environment is an excellent way to orient them to the space and how the subject will be taught. Simply explaining how and why the different tools will be us ed is a great way to kick off the teaching session and will help in establishing expectations and get keen students off on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be part of a &lt;a href=&quot;http:///csulx/strategy/welcome-videos.html&quot;&gt;Welcome Video&lt;/a&gt; and displayed prominently on the subject landing page. Labelling the navigation in a consistent and obvious way can provide students with the necessary signposts needed to find relevant and timely information. Some like to utilise the sites landing page to offer students an updated weekly schedule with links to the relevant lessons and resources. A more interactive way of getting students to orient themselves would be to set up an orientation activity. This could be a scavenger hunt where students find hidden items or a quick quiz that tests if students have read important information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video Recordings: A desktop capture in CSU Replay or recording of an Online Meeting session or Screencast-o-matic can be used to ‘show and tell’ your i2 site to students and is very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject &lt;em&gt;SSS032 Introduction to Learning Online&lt;/em&gt; is a useful resource for students in itself as it introduces Interact2 tools and a range of online teaching and learning strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Guest Lectures</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inviting practitioners and experts to give guest lectures as part of the subject design is an excellent way to provide students with access to the professions. Guest lectures are a way for students to hear and interact with their “peers” in the profession. Experienced practitioners can provide students with an insight into the reality of their work and creates an opportunity to share with students the kinds of tacit skills and knowledge they will need in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement&quot;&gt;Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding guest lectures to your subject is an excellent way for students to engage directly with the professions and gain an insight into contemporary practices. They provide an opportunity for students to not just listen to a presentation but to ask questions and open a dialogue. They provide a simple way of providing students with their first engagement with the profession. Guest lectures also provide a way of forming a greater connections and partnership with the professions as it builds a bridge between the classroom and the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guide&quot;&gt;Guide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started with guest lectures requires a recruitment process to find willing professionals to engage with your students. Professional bodies, both formal and informal, can provide a ready-made network to engage with and seek out speakers. Local small businesses, schools and community groups are another source of potential guests and can provide a different perspective than students may be used to. Planning these lectures to make the most effective use of them content and time requires planning. Aligning the speaker to a specific topic or area of study that students have issues with may assist students making the links required to understand. It may useful to carve out time for question and answers rather than making the session purely one-way. A variation on the lecture is to conduct an interview with the guest and ask students to propose questions as part of a linked activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Meeting&lt;/strong&gt; - Adobe Connect provides an online tool that is perfect for Guest Lectures. Presenters can share slides and documents, share their webcam, interact with student directly or via text chat. It also allows you to record sessions so that students who can’t make it, or who may want to review the presentation can access it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Conferencing&lt;/strong&gt; - the new CSU Video Conferencing system makes it easier than ever to engage with the outside world. Guests can log in using just their web browser. It lacks the interactive and recording features of Adobe Connect but may suit some situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skype and Google Hangouts are other options but dealing with large groups of students can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Choice Within Assessments</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choice Within Assessments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;element-tags-which-elements-does-it-support&quot;&gt;Element Tags (which elements does it support?)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexible and adaptive learning, Interaction with the professions, INteraction between students&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing greater choice within an assessment is a great way to personalise the learning experience for each individual student. Subject enrolments often include students from a wide range of disciplines and assessment tasks can be developed to cater for this diversity. Questions can be aligned with different discipline areas and ask students to draw on those unique aspects of their society. Student could also have choice around the type of artefact they may produce - from essay through a presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement&quot;&gt;Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing students from a range of contexts to apply their own discipline knowledge and draw on their own experiences in their assessment makes the task more relatable and authentic. The student cohort for online learning courses at CSU is quite diverse in terms of the age, location and experience, and this can be a significant asset to a group of learners. Providing students with a choice between multiple questions, pathways and artefacts allows that diversity to be draw out and students can learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guide&quot;&gt;Guide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways to provide greater choice to students in their assessment tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A common question may be responded to with a specific focus on a student’s context and draw from their personal experience or discipline area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The form of the assessment may reflect the discipline of the student and the forms of communication common to that profession. So a ‘writing task’ may be presented as an essay, a report or news article depending on the student’s course of study.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Students may wish a choice of medium for the assignment. Rather than write a traditional essay student could present their work as a presentation, multimedia artefact or video. This can broaden the student’s range of communication skills and promote a variety of digital literacies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word, Powerpoint, YouTube,&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adapting Learning Resources</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data analytics like those provided by Interact2 Site Analytics, can be used to easily discover student use and engagement patterns for content areas and key learning resources. This data can be used towards making adjustments to learning resources and support during a current session, and informing learning resource and support provision in subsequent subject offerings to allow learner pathways that are more responsive to concept learning difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement&quot;&gt;Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These adaptations demonstrate a responsive approach to teaching in order to meet student needs and address issues related to their engagement with the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-practice&quot;&gt;In Practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;subject&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PSC102&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;teaching-staff&quot;&gt;Teaching staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Harper &amp;amp; Geoff Burrows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PSC102 Botany&lt;/em&gt; is a common subject in a number of Bachelor of Agriculture courses and provides a range of resources that if fully utilised will help students succeed in the subject. Information and insights on how students actually use the learning resources provided, and what resources students found to be useful is of immense value towards the development of a more personalised learning approach in a core subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data analytics has provided helpful insights into how students can be helped to succeed in the subject. Providing more personalised learning content, resources and support, allows for a responsive teaching practice and appropriately targeted academic interventions that focus on known problem areas of subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guide&quot;&gt;Guide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data analytics are available in a number of systems used at CSU like Interact2 Site Analytics and CSU Replay. This data can be augmented with information from students gathered from the Discussion Forums or later in the Student Evaluation System. Combining these sources can provide useful and informative data from which to analyse student use of learning resources in order to make adjustments. They provide a picture of how many students accessed the resources, and combined with information from students as to what areas they struggled with, teachers can adapt the resources available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be achieved in a variety of different ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Augment existing resources with additional material by injecting additional sources of information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using existing rich media resources, like YouTube videos, to add explain topic areas. Video and visual resources can often help explain and illustrate difficult concept in different ways.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Link to other sources that describe the topic in different ways to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://hapgood.us/2016/05/13/choral-explanations/&quot;&gt;Choral Explanations&lt;/a&gt; so that students can find an explanation that relates to their way of thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Present students with options and different ways to access learning materials. Some students may prefer to read, some on screen and some on paper, others may prefer to listen or watch their resources. Data analysis can help identify student preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create supplementary resources yourself, like videos, that react and respond to student queries, questions and misunderstandings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>Video Lectures</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video Lectures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;element-tags&quot;&gt;Element Tags&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher Presence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recording Video Lectures for online students provides a richer engagement with the subject concepts than is possible with text. The sound and ‘live’ nature of the resource helps to convey the presence of the teacher. The tone of voice and other aspects of the audio contribute to students understanding of the topic and possible nuances in concepts. Video provides a rich medium to convey information as it can combine visual elements with animation and footage of the lecturer speaking. It also provides an avenue to embed and share some of the teacher’s personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement&quot;&gt;Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video Lectures provide a version of ‘the lecture’ that is more tailored to the online environment. CSU Replay recordings of the internal lecture can sometimes have issues with the audio as the lecturer moves in relation to the microphone and can come across to students as second best. Specifically recording videos shifts the priority to the online students and opens up new possibilities for internal students as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-practice&quot;&gt;In Practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;subject&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCI103&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;teaching-staff&quot;&gt;Teaching staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ana Horta&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Video Lectures help the online students to feel that they are not missing out because of their study mode. They provide an effective way of augmenting the existing content students have and provide a timely way to address questions and provide support to the whole cohort of students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SCI103 video lectures include screen-captures as well as audio and video, and mostly range from 20-40 minutes. They were created to provide online students with more coverage and explanation of the concepts presented in the online modules, textbook and recommended readings. Like lectures, there is one for each week. Through these video lectures the voice and personality of the lecturer comes through as a real human being, and so helps convey teacher presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guide&quot;&gt;Guide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video lectures can be utilised in a variety of ways to augment and support your teaching and engagement with students. They provide a way to communicate directly with the class as a whole but also provide a channel to embed your personality into the subject too. There are however some pitfalls in that make transferring lectures done face-to-face quite challenging, but also some important affordance you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintaining Attention&lt;/strong&gt; - This can be a challenge in a video and it’s why many experts suggest keeping the length of online videos short. There are often more distractions available when studying online and it’s a lot easier to duck off to another Tab in the browser than it is to leave a classroom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio and Visuals&lt;/strong&gt; - Videos require an effort to both audio and visual components. Talking to a single slide is quite common in a face-to-face lecture because there is other visual stimuli available, but that’s not the case in a video. Spending less time on a slide and creating some visual diversity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pause and Rewind&lt;/strong&gt; - One of the unique aspects of video lectures is that it provides students with the ability to pause and rewind. Pausing means that they can come back to the lecture and provides students with added flexibility. The rewind allows students to re-watch the video multiple times. This is great for demonstrations or showing processes to student. It allows them to see how it fits together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate&lt;/strong&gt; - Use video lectures to maintain a dialogue with your students. Keep them up to date with their progress, upcoming deadlines, tips for study and assessment tasks and respond to their questions from the forums or email as a group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csu.edu.au/division/dit/staff/training/self-help/teaching-technology-and-support&quot;&gt;CSU Replay&lt;/a&gt; provides a desktop capture solution that allows you to record and upload presentations back into the system for students to access.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Creating Rich Media Artefacts</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of rich media artefacts including photographic evidence, video records and multimedia presentations by learners can provide an authentic way for learners to develop a variety of digital literacies, technical and communication skills that will be useful in the professions. In addition, the co-construction of rich media artefacts can also offer an authentic collaborative experience for learners and due to advancing and readily available mobile technologies, a range of interactive experiences can be integrated into the collaborative learning environment. In many ways rich media such as video can provide better evidence of students work and their skills and abilities which can greatly improve the effectiveness of the assessment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement&quot;&gt;Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of rich media artefacts can create an engaging learning experience by shifting the attention away from the physical product and on to the learning process. Learners can also engage further self and peer assessment and reflection in an authentic setting. Working with rich media provides an alternative to written assessment tasks and a way for students to express themselves in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guide&quot;&gt;Guide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rich Media provides a different way for students to document, explain or demonstrate their learning. It provides ways of capturing information about what students are learning that are not possible in other mediums. Rich media can capture important information about the student’s environment and situation and provides a way to capture more authentic tasks - in particular getting students to demonstrate and reflect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some important considerations for structuring assessments that utilise rich media include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build additional work around the task. Developing rich media can be time consuming so don’t use it as an add on, but look at opportunities to centre other assessments or activities the student’s work to make it worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use it for self-evaluation and diagnosis. Ask students to record themselves and let them review their performance and get them to link their work to theory and the profession.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build relevant skills with a focus on the what they would benefit from in the profession. What would they do on the job? Tasks that are common and adaptable are presentations of information and literature, in depth discussion of a situation or topic, or taking a side and creating an argument for a debate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rich media lends itself particularly well to engaging in peer-to-peer evaluation and feedback on the work. Students could be asked not just to to identify issues but to make suggestion and provide constructive feedback which is often quite challenging, but engages a deeper level of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To know if using rich media is the right choice in your subject then ask yourself some of the following questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can it provide you with better evidence to assess your students?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will it capture the student’s learning better than an essay?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is it a more authentic and more contextual way to assess the student?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many readily available tools that students can utilise to produce rich media artefacts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mobile devices can record audio and video as well as take photos.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Powerpoint and similar software to combine audio and visuals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud and Flickr provide free and easy ways for students to publish their artefacts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Computer Based Exams</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A computer based exam is a an exam which replaces the more traditional paper based exam and may or may not involve the use of a remote indivigulator to monitor the student/s during the completion of the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement&quot;&gt;Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The provision of computer based exams provide students with a contemporary and flexible method of completing assessment tasks. This approach is more in keeping with the ways that students complete other assessment tasks (i.e. with computers) and is a more flexible practice than the requirement for students to travel to their nearest exam centre to sit a paper based exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-practice&quot;&gt;In Practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;subject&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HIP202 Research for Health Practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;teaching-staff&quot;&gt;Teaching staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kylie Murphy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIP202 Research For Health Practice&lt;/em&gt; is a second year common subject undertaken by most students within the school of Community Health at CSU. The aim of this subject is to begin these students on the journey to becoming evidence based health practitioners. This subject is designed to provide students with an introductory experience to utilising information and research and applying this knowledge to the specific problems of their health discipline/s. Throughout this subject students are taught to, and get the chance to implement a range of skills including the development of sophisticated database search terms (including Boolean operators) creating and saving database permalinks, understanding the structure and function of a wide range of qualitative and qualitative research approaches and associated documentation. Students become skilled at doing all of these things to solve authentic problems over the course of the subject, so the apparent misalignment between the subject and it’s main assessment task, a paper based exam, were clear. Providing students with a large collection of printed resources was both in-authentic and wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a suitable replacement task for this paper based exam revolved around firstly determining alignment between subject outcomes, the assessable components in question and then ensuring that students could access a fair and well designed assessment which was supported by current CSU platforms. In the end, the Interact2 test centre was chosen as the platform because of the support available and (through an extended period of testing and trialing) the ability to remove technical glitches. Over 190 students completed the assessment task simultaneously in a three hour period during exam week in July 2016, with all three student cohorts reporting an increased satisfaction of the subject and the assessment practices, as measured by the student experience survey. Key messages from this implementation process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A team development process is crucial-as the academic, developing and building a vision for what you want to achieve in innovating in your assessments is crucial, but getting people around you so that you can access the right skills at the right time is key-your educational designer can support you with project management on these larger tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sustainability versus ‘do-ability’-at some point, when you have less support, will you be able to carry out some of the trouble shooting yourself? Investing time upfront in understanding how the system will work will gain you time in the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting point-critically analyse what you are offering as assessment, not just how you are offering it-consider all parts when undertaking assessment changes-who, what, when, where, how, why…and for who.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be explicit in linking between learning outcomes and design of the e-exam-particularly useful so that students could see why the changes were being made in this research and information literacy subject&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrate the e-exam into the delivery of the subject i.e. providing advance notice through announcements, practice e-exams, pre-emptive student troubleshooting tips, familiarisation. In essence, consider the user experience of your e-exam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guide&quot;&gt;Guide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to implement a computer based exam within your subject/s, there are some important considerations to make when planning this approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrity - Given that many exams at CSU are relatively high stakes, it is important to take into account the ways which you will maintain the integrity of the assessment task so that students are assessed on a level playing field. If you are planning on utilizing the increasing range of remote invigilator services available (see here) these concerns are somewhat minimized as the student’s identification will be verified by the invigilator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design - If you are not planning on utilising these kinds invigilator services, the design of the exam can increase the integrity of the assessment. For example, an exam containing extended answer sections to complement multiple choice questions gives you as the assessor greater opportunity to cross reference any work against the student’s prior performance within the subject.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exam platform - It is possible to build an effective e-exam within the interact2 test environment. A growing practice is the creation of one overall exam which consists of several ‘tests’, each of which can only be accessed once the previous one has been reviewed and submitted. This has several advantages including the fact that you can choose to make students complete the exam in a specified or random order, and as a result it minimises chances for integrity breaches. In addition, there are a range of functionalities such as the ability to store audio, video and files within the test environment, these being available from other areas of your subject site. Additionally, utilizing the supported test centre functionalities within interact2 means that you can schedule specific opening and closing times for these assessment tasks, meaning that support can be organised around this timeframe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another effective safeguard in ensuring integrity is undertaking a range of pre-moderation activities. In a typical exam environment, students will be presented with the same scenario. In an e-exam, it is possible to present a range of scenarios in which students are asked to apply knowledge and skills. Key to this is the development and pre-moderation of a range of equivalent scenarios that students must respond to. The alternative to this aspect is providing one scenario but a range of ways to respond. Building a range of options makes it harder for collusion to occur, but it is important to follow a rigorous pre- moderation process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are other non-supported technologies for offering e-exams, but utilising these is problematic as they will not link to CSU systems such as grade centre. In some situations bespoke solutions can be created in order to embed currently unsupported software platforms, but this process requires an extensive planning and implementation time frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interact2 - various tools including Test Centre and Grade Centre are important in the design and development of your computer based exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content Creation - you may need to utilise a range of tools including word processing programs such as Word or Pages. Alternatively, Test Centre does have a range of content creation tools including Word/Audio/Video which can be deployed in the test environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Online Marking &amp; Effective Feedback</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is well established that students benefit from constructive feedback on their learning. Everyday learning activities as well as special tasks and tests provide opportunities for the provision of feedback. Online marking presents a diverse range of tools that are designed for provide much richer options for feedback to students that include verbal, visual and written feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement&quot;&gt;Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital tools available today can increase the personalisation possible and can greatly increase the turnaround time. The ability and ease in which quality audio feedback can be incorporated into the marking process can have many positive effects. The students engagement in their assessments is improved with personalised feedback and the teacher’s voice can make distance students feel more connected and reduce feelings of isolations. The use of verbal feedback provides a link for students with someone they know, that is not just a name in a subject outline but a real person, who cares about their progress and achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-practice&quot;&gt;In Practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;subject&quot;&gt;Subject&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BMS 240, BMS241 and BMS352&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;teaching-staff&quot;&gt;Teaching staff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouter Kalle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback is one of the most important aspects in student learning and traditionally scores quite low in the SES scores at CSU. An initiative in the UK called the &lt;em&gt;audio supported enhanced learning support project&lt;/em&gt; (Stewart 2008) set out to use technology to enhance and personalise teaching. A study in the USA found that using audio feedback was faster than written feedback but the quality of the feedback increased at least 2-fold ((Ice, Curtis, Phillips, &amp;amp; Wells, 2007). Whilst this is not the place to give a full review on the benefits of audio feedback, there is widespread agreement in the literature that audio feedback is a superior form of feedback which will enhance learning and teaching (Dickson, 2015)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However another maybe even more important aspect of audio feedback is the opportunity to provide a more personal connection with the student which could lead to more engagement of the students with their subject, their course and even the university (Rowe 2011). Studies have shown an increased ability to understand the feedback, as there is more nuance and intonation and greater feelings of subject involvement especially in distance education (Oleseva and Richardson 2011). All this means that audio feedback can provide a system to create greater personal contact and maybe even emotional support (Rowe 2011). This shows that this type of feedback could be an extremely useful tool to increase subject engagement and student retention in online programs at CSU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly, the audio feedback system is set up as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assignments are downloaded from EASTS website on the due date.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the text different coloured highlights are made and if necessary comments are created using MS-word.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using MS-Word, the criteria are pasted in front of the assignment and the levels attained are highlighted and marks are awarded to each separate criterion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final marks are recorded in spreadsheet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using a very simple Apple Mac app (called lecture recorder) and the computer microphone audio feedback is recorded for the student. The student’s first name is used and both the criteria and marks, are discussed.  The various highlights and comments in the text are explained.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The recording is usually between 3 minutes (very good marks, HD level) and 7 minutes (lots of remarks, usually PS/CR level).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marked files are sent back to the students through EASTS to record return date&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An email is sent to the students using the EASTS handing-in email containing the marked file and the audio file. This ‘double-up’ is done as the linking of the audio file to the marked document does not work very well and sometimes the audio file gets lost in the EASTS transition. Also this is a point of Quality Control to check whether all assignments have been marked and marks recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quality Control is ensured by using the original file names for the audio files and consistently using student numbers and student names to record audio feedback and marks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audio feedback always flows according to a fixed pattern. Below is an excerpt of a typical audio feedback file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Good morning (students first name), I just wanted to give you some audio feedback on your (subject code) assignment. As you can see I have copied and pasted the criteria in front of your work and blocked out the levels you have attained in pink. I added up all the marks and you scored X marks out of a hundred”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A description of the levels attained follows including an explanation why these were attained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Looking at your assignment I have highlighted some parts which will be discussed now”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlights are in different colours depending on whether they are regarding content, grammar, referencing or general. An explanation of the highlights and comments follows while slowly going through the text. According to personal feedback, students can actually follow the marking and comments through the text and are never lost. The audio feedback always ends with a conclusion and some words of encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In short, you have achieved X marks, if you would pay attention to (a brief repeat of previous comments) you would easily score a (higher) level. I really enjoyed reading and marking your assignment and looking forward to seeing more of your work”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guide&quot;&gt;Guide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to implementing completely online marking within your subject/s, there are some important considerations to make when planning this approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider the platform most suitable for your cohort and the assessment task.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The virtues of audio feedback (like any feedback) seem to lay mostly in the detail of the feedback, the guidance it gives to increase quality in future work, the personal touch it gives and the idea of connection to the subject and university as is shown in the above comments and the many emails on the topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Welcome Videos</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A welcome video of between 5-10 minutes can be used at the commencement of a new subject by the academic/instructor to provide aspects such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introductory information about the subject such as how it fits in with the students wider course that the student is completing-e.g. What prior learning it builds upon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clarify early concerns that the academic suspects students might hold based on his/her prior experience in delivering the subject-for example the academic might flag that students need to consider completing a pre-requisite subject&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Makes clear the primary methods of communication that will be utilised throughout the subject&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;provides students some introductory background regarding the academic’s experience and background in this field of study, giving students a sense of confidence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highlight key aspects of the assessment for the subject and key teaching and learning information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gives students some insight into interests or hobbies etc in order to position themselves as someone who is also managing the demands of work, study and life and which provides an opening for students to themselves provide some some information which can help form the basis of deeper engagement when studying online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement&quot;&gt;Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of a welcome video, available before or at the start of session helps a student establish the context for the teaching, learning and assessment that will occur in the subject. Providing this information in a video, instead of solely relying on a text-based approach, helps students more readily identify with the academic. Providing a welcome video which clearly articulates expectations and highlights the important aspects of the subject can be a foundation to increasing learner-to-academic interaction, this being a key aspect in increasing learner engagement. Research such as that carried out as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowses.edu.au/assets/ALTC%20LSES%20Final%20Report%202012.pdf&quot;&gt;LSES report&lt;/a&gt; clearly highlights the need for students, particularly those from non traditional backgrounds, to be able to feel that their lecturers are approachable and support their learning journey. Providing a welcome video is an important part of the strategy mix in achieving these aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guide&quot;&gt;Guide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a successful Welcome Video there are some decisions to make:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t try to explain every topic/week within the video - focus on aspects such as summarising the learning outcomes and describing the assessment tasks in conjunction with details that will allow students to make a successful commencement to the subject. The intention should be to welcome students and complement the information that is already available to them. To that end, prioritise the key messages you want students to know when they finish your welcome video.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider the context of the video - can you get creative and record the video in a location other than your office? For example, for a science subject, could you record the welcome video in the lab? Getting a colleague to assist you to record via e.g. smartphone in a genuine setting is at least as powerful for students as a click through powerpoint with voiceover, and your enthusiasm for the subject will be readily apparent to students.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The creation of a welcome video need not be onerous - rather than creating a start to finish ‘script’, an equally useful approach is to create a series of headings with supporting ‘talking points.’ A ‘welcome’ video will potentially feel more welcoming if it is relatively informal and accessible, with just the key aspects conveyed to students. Equally important is the fact that you needn’t feel compelled to have every latest feature in your video production - a simply delivered clear message that students can identify with is more than adequate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about how your use of a welcome video fits in with your broader plan to build and maintain your teacher presence and how you will communicate with students throughout the subject. Successful student communication is relevant, timely and accessible. Your communication approach shouldn’t be a moving target for students-in other words, utilising a smaller range of communication strategies in an effective and efficient way means greater consistency and provides one less barrier for success for online learners who will quickly learn where and how you communicate-a trait online students appreciate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a welcome video there is a wide variety of tools available, many of them CSU supported technologies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSU Replay/Personal Capture&lt;/strong&gt; (Echo360) - useful when you wish to capture both yourself as a ‘talking head’ in conjunction with what you are presenting. Of course this software provides options such as voice capture with screen only. A useful tool because the start to finish process can be handled from your desktop;it’s a CSU supported technology and provides ease of insertion into your subject space within interact2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adobe Connect&lt;/strong&gt; - used primarily within CSU as a meeting tool, but does provide a screenshare and recording functionality-particularly useful if you intend on providing a recording of an online meeting you have run as a ‘Welcome’ type meeting at the start of your subject.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer webcams&lt;/strong&gt; - you can create a direct to camera recording utilising the webcam and microphone on your desktop/laptop (PC or mac) and there a numerous options for making this available e.g. storing and streaming in youtube as a private channel and embedding in your interact2 homepage or uploading the file into i2 as well (not recommended as students will incur greater download charges).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile technologies&lt;/strong&gt; - such as ipads and smartphones can provide you with a quick and easy way to capture footage ‘in the real world.’ Be aware that these files can quickly become large in size and emailing as a means of moving files can quickly degrade the quality, rendering them unusable. The best way to move these files is through a cloud storage solution such as google drive or dropbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflection is an internal dialogue facilitated by writing and creative strategies as a way of expressing, sharing, assessing and developing professional experience. By recognising and taking responsibility for personal and professional identity, values, action and feelings the student undertaking reflection within the constructs of a subject or course is demonstrating a willingness to stay with uncertainty, doubt and questioning in order to engage in spirited enquiry leading to constructive developmental change and professional integrity based on deep understanding. Knowing what to reflect upon is as critical a part of the educative process as the reflection action itself, and is a pedagogical approach that draws in reflective practice and reflexivity - finding strategies to question attitudes, values and limits of personal knowledge. A key area in the development of the professional practitioner is the ability to reflect on practise as part of the process of learning in order to foster continuous professional growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital reflective journals are part of a pedagogically enriched learning design within online or technology-rich context to support and improve learning experiences. A reflective journal is also especially useful for assessing intended learning outcomes  relating to the application of content knowledge, professional judgement and reflection on past decisions and problem solving, with a view to improving them. Reflective thinking also helps students develop a questioning attitude and new perspective; identify areas for change and improvement; respond effectively to challenges; and generalise and apply what they have learned from one situation to other situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to online learning students need time to locate their new learning within framework of their subject or course, and academics as teachers need to support and nurture learners to learn within the same connected and collaborative learning environments as teaching takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement&quot;&gt;Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A digital reflective journal written as a blog provides students with the freedom to engage with content, ideas, discoveries, disappointments, or  to simply ponder their learning. Online learning journals should be open and shared spaces, ready for enjoyment as well as providing an opportunity for students to demonstrate functioning knowledge.  Part of the engagement is being able to share with others in the cohort, as a participatory learning experience, and to make use of  (or learn how to) leverage the affordances of online platforms to better engage with  content or  leverage available resources to communicate thoughts, discoveries, academic reflections, and multimedia artefacts. Students are also able to demonstrate learning through multimodal additions to the online reflective journal.  A reflective journal provides a flexible and responsive way to share the joy of learning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This keystone subject establishes the reflective journal process for use within the subject, but more particularly within the whole course. Students are encouraged to extend themselves by peer responses to their work, and are motivated to explore and embrace the affordances of the online environment to explore their knowledge and share their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSU Thinkspace provided the ideal vehicle for transforming learning experiences through the use of a reflective journal. Using a CSU username and password students are introduced to a platform that has full flexibility for customisation to reflect personal preferences and provide a touch of motivation. Importantly this is also linked to a range of  formative steps supported by the academic in building knowledge and understanding:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Key topics for reflection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Peer-to-peer responses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teacher feedback&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Literacy and communication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Celebration of learning achievements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I found the blogging aspect really helpful to make connections and illustrate my learning to myself and others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“HAVING to create a professional blog - helpful for me to clarify and reflect on my learning throughout this subject; and great to be able to share my classmates learning via their blogs too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guide&quot;&gt;Guide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In looking for opportunities to develop and offer students an opportunity to engage in reflective journalling there are a range of considerations that need to be made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reflective journals provide an opportunity for students to explore, ask questions, respond to readings, summarize key ideas, recognise strengths and weaknesses in their emerging professional understanding and/or practice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand why you are introducing this strategy. Reflective journals can be a powerful way to build understanding while also providing a responsive mechanism for personalisation of the learning process. However the process is unlikely to be nurtured by introducing too many compulsory posts, tight timelines, or other artificial constraints particularly where there is no teacher presence visible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider your strategy for  engaging interaction between students, in order to build community while also fostering a capacity for personal autonomy and accountability in the process of knowledge networking. Link the reflective journal activity to connected learning experiences or elements of professional practice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a decision about the contextual setting of your reflective journal activities.  Will your cohort be working in Interact2 in a ‘closed’ learner-community space, or will your cohort be working in open, collaborative public spaces engaging with the cohort and beyond with the discipline and/or profession?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All forms of online learning journals are valuable, but should be designed to best support the required participatory experiences of individual subjects or courses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is best not to ask students to cut and paste blog posts and place them into a discussion forum, or vice versa. However, some students do like to share the depth of their growing ideas and understanding,  and how they do this in relation to a reflective journal post is up to them or your class structures. For example, students can provide a link to their post via Twitter and the subject hashtag, or perhaps begin a discussion forum post with “I have just written a post about….” providing a linked URL and commenting on why that post has been important to their emerging understanding relevant to the Discussion forum.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An online journal post can extend on, or allow deeper personal deliberation of content emerging in the class discussion forum.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work may be formative or summative, therefore careful consideration of the learning design of the subject and/or course is essential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
