{% assign listed_posts_urls = page.url | split: ' ' %}
{% for tag in page.tags %}
  {% for mypost in site.tags[tag] %}
    {% if listed_posts_urls contains mypost.url %}
    {% else %}
      <div>
        <h5><a href="{{ mypost.url }}">{{ mypost.title }}</a></h5>
      </div>
      {% assign listed_posts_urls = listed_posts_urls | push: mypost.url %}
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
